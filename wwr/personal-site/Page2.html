        <p id="mid-text">The cabin will be located out by lava hot springs. Over there is plenty of nature that we can enjoy. Most things we can do outside but if we put our heads together I'm sure we can also find indoor activities. One of the main highlights of the area is of course the hotsprings. There is also a river that can be floated.

        <p id="bot-text">Since we will be in Lava Hot Springs area it also means that we will pass by Pocatello. Last year the Pocatello Idaho temple was built. I personally went in during the open house and it was super pretty. If we plan ahead then we can set up an appointment and do baptisms for the dead. If we don't want to do that then we can just walk around the temple and take pictures. We could also go explore Pocatello since it is a "city".</p>
