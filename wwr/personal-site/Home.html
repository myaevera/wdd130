            <h3>Scheduling</h3>
            <p id="bottom-right">Of course it would be great if everyone would come but we do recognize that we all live busy lives and have lots of things we want to do on the weekend. The weekend we are currently planning to go is on November 4th-6th. Nothing has been finalized but we will like to reserve the cabin as soon as possible. So if that weekend doesn't work for or if you have a suggestion for another weekend please call or text me!!!</p>
