        <h2>Splitting the Costs</h2>
        <p id="middle-text">This trip is going to be fun but it's sadly going to drain of us of out most vital source: MONEY! To minimize the cost we will be doing the age old practice of splitting costs. So we will need to finalize the number of people so that we can finalize the big costs. The general costs we will have is food, the cabin, and gas. We will also need to talk who the drivers are. If you are planning on coming on this trip please come to my apartment this Thursday so we can finalize details and exchange money. </p>

    <p id="bottom-text">Everyone that got this link is somebody that we want to come on this trip. We have enjoyed the friendships we have been able to form connections with everyone of you. This will be a super fun trip and we wish to see everyone of you there. This will cost money but in 40 years when we're all wrinkly and old we won't care that we dropped 50$ on a weekend trip with friends. We are going to look back on the memories that we made on this trip and laugh. This trip will live on even when we all split and go onto our own journey's in this life. Let's indulge in the now!</p>
